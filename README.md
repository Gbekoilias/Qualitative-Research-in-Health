## 2. Provide a clear discussion of
   – what is qualitative research, what are the key features and characteristics. 
   - What you could also do is flag up some of the different methodological approaches but be careful about being too descriptive here 
   – there are differences between methodologies, but there is more that unites qualitative approaches than divides.
   - If you have space, briefly compare qualitative methods with quantitative research. (roughly 500 words)

## 3. Describe some of the research studies that use qualitative methods approach in health/public health studies (examples are provided in the reading list + use library searches)
   - Here, it might make sense to focus on an area of research that you are interested in (e.g., obesity or active travel, for example). (shorter section – 150-200 words)

## 4. Provide a clear overview of the methods/methodology used in the paper
   - what you think are the advantages (and disadvantages) of these approaches for addressing that research problem
   - Specific methodologies (e.g. ethnography or phenomenology) have specific advantages and disadvantages, so do expand on these if needed. (roughly 600 words)

## 5. Provide a short conclusion/summary, highlighting some of the main points of your essay, and coming to some conclusion about what contribution you think qualitative research methods can make to health/public health research. (50-100 words)
